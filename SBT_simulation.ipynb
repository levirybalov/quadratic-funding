    "## Model (One-Shot)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model consists of the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* agents $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n \\in A$ \n",
    "\n",
    "* projects $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_m \\in P$\n",
    "\n",
    "* clusters $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_s \\in C$\n",
    "\n",
    "* agents budgets $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$\n",
    "\n",
    "* agents private beliefs $l_1, l_2, \\ldots, l_n \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m+}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* agents have public voices $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $v_i \\le b_i, \\ \\forall a \\in A$ \n",
    "\n",
    "* each pair of agents $a_i, a_j$ have a set of affiliations over clusters $f_{ij} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{s+}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* agent-agent-cluster affiliation matrix $F$\n",
    "\n",
    "* each cluster $c_i$ has a set of affiliations over project $p_j$, $g_{ij} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m+}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* cluster-project affiliation matrix $G$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to accomodate the equations in the SBT paper, we need a function to reduce the set of agent-agent affiliations over clusters to a single value. For now, to get a single agent-agent affiliation, we simply take the sum of the values in the corresponding agent-agent affiliation vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to account for affiliations of clusters to projects, we can transform the agent-agent-cluster matrix to a agent-agent-project matrix, and then reduce those values (as before, for now, we simply take the sum of the values).\n",
    "\n",
    "This process gives a way to model the agents' public voices from their private beliefs, and Wgives us a setting from which we can plug values into the equations in the SBT paper\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential goal is to have agents' private beliefs equal their public voices (incentive-compatiblity).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to weight the importance every agent gives to every cluster in order to get a more refined consolidation of agent-agent affiliation (the same is true of clusters giving importance to projects).\n",
    "\n",
    "We are multiplying agents' affiliation weights by the other agents' private values, not public values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior research on homophily, diffusion, and learning in networks can be leveraged in this environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use matrix factorization and other decomposition methods to make some interesting insights (given real-world data). "
